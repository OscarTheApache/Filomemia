Mind if i praise the Lord?

I have only two rules when it comes to saying nigga. One, is when i try to explain why i keep saying nigga. Two, is when im either quoting The boondocks, Atlanta, or Training Day. Those Three pieces of media have made an impact on what that word really means. For starters, i'm mexican, so making despective fun to members of our community is shit we do since we are also human beings.
